 Trivia Wars provides users with the opportunity to learn and compete in a variety of different topics including Music, Math, Geography, and Sports in a fun and dynamic way. Our app incorporates a classic trivia quiz approach, but also provides users with the choice of either a single player or multiplayer mode. In addition to these different game modes, users can register and keep track of their stats and performance with a live leaderboard and stat tracker on the user homepage. The live leaderboard tracks user results in both game modes and reflects cumulative performance, which adds a fun, competitive element to each game played.

 To achieve this balance, we required the use of multiple key technologies; sockiet.io, passport, express, react js, and MongoDB. Through the use of these technologies we were able to implement and weave together our user authorization, live multiplayer gameplay, and user stat storage.

 To run this app on your local machine, first run 'npm run seed' in order to get your database up and running  on your local machine (Note: you must also have mongod running in you terminal). You can then run 'npm start' to get the react app running on the local host. Once you have the app running you can log in, or register if you don't have an account yet, and will be taken to the user page with your stats printed on the left and the overall leaderboard on the right.
